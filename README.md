API's:
DarkSky - for weather information
GoogleMaps - for fetching the latitude and longitude of an address


# NodeAPP3

"express": Used to create a server to run the application
"mocha": "^4.0.1",
"rewire": "^3.0.1",
"supertest": "^3.0.0"


# NodeAPP5
Purpose: Exploring commonly used security protocols in creating node applications. This application creates a TODOs application that is able to provide security for information held by different users.

"mocha": Testing suite used to test the functions created in the application
"nodemon": Used to auto reload the server after a change
"supertest": Provides a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP


# NodeAPP6
Purpose: Creating a real time web application that allows for users to enter chat rooms and talk with other individuals in the same room. Highlighting to a higher degree the functions of the previous examples. The application utilizes front and backend technologies to

Live Example: https://thawing-anchorage-24776.herokuapp.com/
